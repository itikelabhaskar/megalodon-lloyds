# Hello Hackers! 👋

Here are some details about what you will be doing at the hackathon. We can't wait to see what you create!

## Devices & Set-Up

- Please bring your own personal devices to participate.
- You will code in a sandbox environment enabled for these 2 days. Login details will be provided at the venue.

## The Challenges

Your team will be allocated a challenge based on a problem statement. The theme for the Hackathon is Agentic AI.

## Pitches

On day two, all teams will pitch their game to their assigned coaches. Coaches will then shortlist teams to present to our judging panel.

Teams will have 5 minutes each to pitch to coaches. Shortlisted hackers will have 8 minutes + 2 minutes for Q&A when pitching to judges.

You can use slides, a live demo, or any other format you like to present your game. Be creative and have fun!

- Pitches to the coaches will begin at 12:15pm
- Pitches to the judges will begin at 2:15pm

## Judging Criteria

Our judges will be considering the following when casting their vote:

Value and Proposition (20%)

**Business Value:** Does the solution address a real problem or opportunity? Is it likely to deliver measurable impact for users, customers, or the organisation?

**Market Overview:** Is there a clear understanding of the market landscape? Has the team identified competitors, gaps, and potential for adoption or growth?

Agentic Feasibility (20%)

**Agentic Architecture:** Does the solution leverage agentic AI principles (autonomy, decision-making, multi-agent collaboration)? Is the approach technically sound and feasible within current or near-future capabilities?

**Scalability & Integration:** Can the solution be realistically implemented and scaled within your organisation's tech stack? Are integration points with existing systems considered?

Innovation & Originality (20%)

**Creativity:** Is the idea novel or does it offer a fresh approach to an existing challenge? Does it stand out from other submissions?

**Theme Alignment:** How well does the solution embody the hackathon's theme of Agentic AI?

Technical Execution (20%)

**Functionality:** Is there a working prototype or MVP? Does it demonstrate the core features and agentic capabilities?

**Quality & Robustness:** Is the solution stable, well-documented, and free from major bugs? Is the technical approach well-justified?

Usability & Accessibility (10%)

**User Experience:** Is the solution intuitive and easy to use? Can users quickly understand and interact with the agentic AI features?

**Accessibility:** Are there options or considerations for users with different needs or backgrounds?

Presentation & Communication (10%)

**Pitch Quality:** Is the team able to clearly articulate their idea, its value, and how agentic AI is applied? Is the presentation engaging and convincing?

## Winners

Judges will deliberate and will announce the winners at 5pm.
